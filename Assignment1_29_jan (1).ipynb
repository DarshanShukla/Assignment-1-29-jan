    "        * Rules for Identifiers in Python\n",
    "            To construct a Python identifier, a few requirements must be fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "           - Reserved keywords (special words used for a specific purpose, e.g., while, for, if, etc.) cannot be used as identifier names.\n",
    "           - Python identifiers can contain lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numerals (0-9), and underscores ( _ ).\n",
    "             This means that Identifiers in Python cannot contain special characters except underscore in them.\n",
    "           - The name of the identifier cannot begin with a number.\n",
    "           - The name of a Python identifier can begin with an underscore.\n",
